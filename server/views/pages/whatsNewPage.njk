            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Deadline for probation practitioners to complete licences</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                From April 30, probation practitioners will not be able to work on licences from 2 days before a standard release.<br><br>
                In the rare case that no licence has been submitted by this point, case administrators in the prison will be able to use this service to generate 
                a standard licence. These licences must be approved by senior prison staff, such as duty governors.<br><br>
                At this point, practitioners will only be able to ask the prison to change someone’s initial appointment.<br><br>
                All standard licences generated by the prison need to be reviewed by a probation practitioner as soon as possible following release.<br><br>
                This is when changes to things like additional or bespoke licence conditions can be made.<br><br>
                Licences for people being released early are not affected by this deadline.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Generating a standard licence</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                To generate a standard licence for someone who has not had a licence submitted in time, 
                case admin just need to choose that person from their case list.<br><br>
                Before release, these licences will display to probation practitioners with a status of “timed out”.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Licence conditions</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Case admin will not be able to add any additional or bespoke conditions to standard licences generated in the service.<br><br>
                By default, these licences will automatically contain the following restrictions:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-body">
                <li>standard conditions</li>
                <li>the following additional condition:</li><br>
                Not to approach or communicate with any victims of your offences without the prior approval of your supervising officer.
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Other additional or bespoke conditions can be added by the probation practitioner after release.
            </p>
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Initial appointment</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Case admin can choose to set the initial appointment for immediately after release, 
                by 2pm the next working day or at a specific date and time requested by the probation practitioner.<br><br>
                Case admin can change the initial appointment details any time before release, 
                for example if the probation practitioner requests this. If the licence has already been approved, 
                it will not need to be approved again.<br><br>
