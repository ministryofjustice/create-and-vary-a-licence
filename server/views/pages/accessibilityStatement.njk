            <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Create and vary a licence service, available at: 
                <br>
                <a  class="govuk-link" href="{{ cvlLink }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">{{ cvlLink }}</a>

            <p>
                Create and vary a licence is run by HMPPS Digital Services. We want as many people as possible to be able to use it. 
                That means you should be able to:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                    <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                    <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
                    <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this service is</h2>

            <p>
                We know some parts of this service are not fully accessible:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Some parts of forms are not grouped together programmatically. This means the question being asked can appear separate to the box where the information can be entered for screen reader users </li>
                    <li>Some text used to describe information requested on forms is not clear enough, which can cause issues for screen readers</li>
                    <li>Some pages are not properly formatted with a clear layout and structure, making them harder for screen reader users to navigate</li>
                    <li>Links are not descriptive enough to allow screen reader users to determine where they go</li>
                    <li>Several page titles do not adequately describe what is on the pages</li>
                    <li>Some pages are missing labels that allow parts of them to be selected using speech recognition software</li>
                    <li>There are several issues with the PDF licence document created by the service. For example, it is missing tags that tell screen readers what kind of information is present</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                    <li>The PDF licence document created by the service is difficult for screen readers to navigate because page elements such as headings, images and lists are not properly labelled. This does not meet
