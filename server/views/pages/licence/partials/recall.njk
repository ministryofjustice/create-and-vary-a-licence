        If you fail to submit yourself to a recall to custody following either a notification of the revocation of your licence,
        or remain out of contact with Probation Services for a period of six months, you may be liable to face a further charge
        of being unlawfully at large following recall under section 255ZA of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This could result in
        a fine, a sentence of up to two years imprisonment, or both.
