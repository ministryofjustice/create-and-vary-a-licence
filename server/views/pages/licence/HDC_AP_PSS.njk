         licence to confirm your identity. Your curfew will then run until the curfew finish time the following morning.
         On your last day of curfew the contractor will visit you to remove the tag and monitoring equipment. This will

         Your compliance with the conditions of the Home Detention Curfew will be monitored by the electronic
         monitoring contractor. You must provide the contractor with access to the curfew address to install and check
         the monitoring equipment and electronic tag. Such visits will be made during your curfew hours but not between
         midnight and 6:00 am. However, the contractor may visit the curfew address between midnight and 6:00 am in
         order to investigate a reported violation.

         The monitoring equipment will usually operate via the mobile cellular network and will only need a dedicated
         telephone line to be fitted if the mobile signal is poor at the curfew address. You will be responsible for
         meeting the cost of the small amount of electricity used by the monitoring equipment at your curfew address.
         It is your responsibility to ensure that there is an electricity supply available during your time on
         curfew.
      </p>

   <div class="section">
      <p>
         In the event of a dedicated telephone line needing to be installed you must agree to the installation at
         your curfew address for use by the supplier. The supplier will notify you of a time and a date and you must be
         present, and provide access to, the curfew address at the notified time to allow installation to take place.
         The installation will normally take place during standard working hours and is fully paid for by the
         supplier.

         While on Home Detention Curfew you may be liable to recall to prison if you breach the condition of this

         <ol type="i">
            <li>You are absent from your curfew address during the specified curfew hours</li>
            <li>You commit violence against or threaten the contractor or any of their staff with violence</li>
            <li>You damage or tamper with the monitoring equipment</li>

         The contractor may authorise a one-off absence from your place of curfew in clearly defined circumstances, which
         you will be informed about by the contractor in writing. You must contact the contractor in advance of any such
         absence to seek authorisation where this is possible. If it is not possible to contact the contractor in
         advance, you must contact them as soon as possible thereafter. Absence for any other reason other than these
         clearly defined circumstances will constitute a breach of your curfew condition. You can contact the monitoring contractor on 0800 137 291.
